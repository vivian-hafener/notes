# Vivian's Notes

I tend to learn new technologies the best by taking detailed notes from their documentation, and then playing around with those technologies and expanding my notes as needed to include novel details. I find that this fulfills the educational principle of learning by teaching, along with learning by doing. This means that my notes often look like documentation, but it is critical to understand that ***they are not.*** :)
