# Leveraging Dashboards to Replace Meetings

### Meetings in the current paradigm
- The landscape has changed in the past 5 years: 1,2 meetings per day in-person --> many, many virtual meetings
- Quantity has decreased and quality (engagement) has decreased
- The current paradigm is not working for us & should be reworked
- Check with meeting hosts if you can drop from meetings that you think are unnecessary / out of scope
- Label meetings with their purpose --> not just a general topic. Set the agenda as questions, instead of subjects

### Dashboards as a mean to replace meetings
- They mostly are referring to the context of data calls, but this is widely applicable
- Identify leading and trailing indicators in our work & make that visible
- Make use of deep dives & drilldowns
- Who do you need status updates from? These are the only people who should attend the meeting.
